# Movie-Recommendation-System
A recommender system uses a statistical algorithm to forecast usersâ€™ ratings for a specific entity. The assumption is users will rate a group of items.  

Have you ever questioned how Netflix makes recommendations for movies based on the ones you've already seen? Or how can choices like "Frequently Bought Together" appear on an e-commerce website? Although they may appear to be straightforward choices, a sophisticated statistical method is used to forecast these suggestions. Recommendation engines, recommendation systems, and recommender systems are all terms used to describe these systems. A recommender system is one of the most well-known uses of data science and machine learning.

Based on the similarity between the items or the similarity between the users who previously evaluated those entities, a recommender system uses a statistical algorithm to forecast users' ratings for a specific entity. The assumption is that users of like categories will rate a group of items similarly.
